# 🔦 Failure Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This repository contains a **Power BI interactive dashboard** designed for **failure analysis and warranty decision-making** in LED lighting products.  

It helps management and engineers track:
- Product failures by product, batch, and branch
- Warranty vs. out-of-warranty failures
- Root causes of defects (Load, Driver, Mix, Component Failure)
- Trends over time for continuous quality improvement
